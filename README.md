# Healthcare Resource Portal (PWA)

A lightweight, installable Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to provide fast access to essential healthcare resources. This app functions offline, installs like a native app, and organizes quick links, directories, forms, and help desk information into one simple, accessible tool.

## 📌 Project Purpose
The **Healthcare Resource Portal** serves as a quick-access toolkit for healthcare workers, IT support staff, and clinical teams. It simplifies the process of finding important contacts, forms, patient education materials, and support documentation—especially useful in environments where time and accuracy matter.

This project was built for an assignment requiring:
- A working PWA  
- Service worker functionality (offline use)  
- A manifest file  
- Deployment through GitHub Pages  
- A short video walkthrough
